voltages, circuits, transistors, and silicon. (raspberry pi)

operating system provides interfaces (UNIX)

software manipulates the interfaces (Node.js)


UNIX
- Kernel (hub: time, memory to programs, file store, comms with system calls)
- Shell (interface: user -> kernal  ) ( Node.js ? )
- Program ( JavaScript File )

everything in unix is either a file or a process

process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier)

file is a collection of data
